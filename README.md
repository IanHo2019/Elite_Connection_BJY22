# Review on Web of Power ([Bai et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac041))

The paper by [Bai et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac041) has been discussed a lot (particularly by Chinese researchers) since its publication on *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*, perhaps because of its novel idea or special data. Here, I'm going to summarize this paper, replicate some of its results (by Stata 18), and share my comments, just for fun.
