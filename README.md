# Review on Web of Power ([Bai et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac041))

The paper by [Bai et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac041) has been discussed a lot (particularly by Chinese researchers) since its publication on *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*, perhaps because of its novel idea or special data.
